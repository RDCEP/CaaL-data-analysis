Week of June 19
Jeremy started on June 19.
We began by exploring the data and plotting it.  We sorted buildings by type and plotted against time and temperature.
Goals from Friday, June 23 meeting: Make bar plots with cumulative data; look at temporal patterns; normalize for building area; look for correlations with weather data
Associated files: Plots+by+Building+Type(1), Cumualtive+Usage, Temporal+Usage(1)

Week of June 26
Abby started on June 26.
We made bar plots following the specifications discussed at out June 23 meeting.
We worked on creating functions for different plots.
Goals from Thursday, June 29 meeting: Research standards for energy use by building type; compare meters to decouple usage and find base loads; identify the most costly buildings; look for correlations with age; start a narrative document on GitHub
We created a new csv file without hospital buildings following our meeting on June 29 in which it was determined to focus on non-hospital energy usage.
We identified errors and inconsistencies in the raw data and corrected them.  We added edited data files to a Box folder.
Associated files: Cumulative+Usage+by+Building+Type, Academic+Usage, Administrative+Usage, Dorm+Usage, Hospital+Usage, Lab+Usage, Library+Usage, Service+Usage, Graph by code or building type (function), Usages separated by building type (Function)
